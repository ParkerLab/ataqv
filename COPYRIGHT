The fonts used in the web visualizer are licensed under the SIL Open
Font License:

    -----------------------------------------------------------
    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    PREAMBLE

    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
    worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support
    the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities,
    and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be
    shared and improved in partnership with others.

    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified
    and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by
    themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
    bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software
    provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative
    works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
    under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to
    remain under this license does not apply to any document created
    using the fonts or their derivatives.

    DEFINITIONS

    "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the
    Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as
    such. This may include source files, build scripts and
    documentation.

    "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after
    the copyright statement(s).

    "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software
    components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

    "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to,
    deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the
    components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by
    porting the Font Software to a new environment.

    "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
    obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge,
    embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified
    copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
    in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be
    bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided
    that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this
    license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files,
    human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable
    metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
    fields can be easily viewed by the user.

    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved
    Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the
    corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to
    the primary font name as presented to the users.

    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the
    Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise
    any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of
    the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit
    written permission.

    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
    remain under this license does not apply to any document created
    using the Font Software.

    TERMINATION

    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions
    are not met.

    DISCLAIMER

    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER

    CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN
    ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS
    IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
